# Raw Idea: Global View Controls

## Feature Description

Phase 2, steps 10-12 from the roadmap:

**Step 10**: Global Context Panel — Add a right-side panel displaying aggregate global data: total urban population, number of cities, regional breakdowns (M effort)

**Step 11**: Epoch Slider Improvements — Move the epoch slider into the global context panel on the right, placing it at the top. Make the current year prominent, with the slider below the year (or shown when hovered). In this way a user can quickly see in the top right what epoch they are on, and the rest of the global sidebar shows data for that year (S effort)

**Step 12**: Zoom Slider — Add a vertical zoom level slider over the the map, to the left of the global context panel. This slider should move when a user zooms up or down. It should have notches with named levels as follows (with text to give you what users would explore at that zoom level):
- **Building**: Individual structures, heights, typologies
- **Street**: Network patterns, walkability, public space
- **Neighborhood**: Local amenities, 15-minute city
- **City**: Overall form, radial profiles, growth patterns
- **Metropolitan**: Regional connections, polycentric structure
(S effort)

## Context

This is for a global urban data observatory website (theurban.world) built with Nuxt. The goal of Phase 2 is to "Enhance the global view with temporal and zoom controls, plus a context panel for aggregate data insights."

## Effort Estimates

- Step 10: M (Medium)
- Step 11: S (Small)
- Step 12: S (Small)
